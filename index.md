***TL;DR:*** Designing tools for mental health practitioners that will help them somewhere in the typical practitioner's workflow. Attempting to involve practitioners as much as possible in the process to ensure alignment of designed tool with practitioners' needs. 

## Project Brief

This project aims to advance the academic study of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) within the context of mental health by developing specialized tools to support mental health practitioners. The primary objective is to design and prototype tailor-made assistive solutions that streamline administrative tasks and automate mundane jobs, allowing practitioners to focus more on patient care. Research activities include understanding how mental health practitioners leverage existing digital tools, identifying the potential for improvement and designing and evaluating solutions.

The study will employ mixed-method research techniques, including a literature review and interviews, to gather insights from practising mental health professionals. Research participants will be mental health counsellors either practising or with experience practising. Solutions will be prototyped in collaboration with the participants through participatory design workshops with iterative refinements based on their feedback. Body-storming activities and an expert appraisal will further validate the efficiency of the prototypes.

Through this research, I hope to reduce the administrative burden on counsellors, improve patient engagement and tracking, and ultimately contribute to better outcomes while improving the quality of life of practitioners.
