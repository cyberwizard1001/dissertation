## Crafting counselling companions: Supporting mental health practitioners with tailored tools

You are being invited to take part in a research study.  Before you decide whether or not you wish to take part it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve.  Please read this information carefully and if you decide to take part, you will be asked to sign a consent form. However, you are free to withdraw at any time, without giving any reason and without any penalty or loss of benefits.

### What is the purpose of the research?
This research is being conducted to support my dissertation project being undertaken as part of my MSc in Human Computer Interaction. It’s an attempt at designing a collection of tailored assistive technologies for use in therapy sessions to support Mental Health Practitioners that will automate relatively mundane tasks, allowing them to focus on what they do best – assess, diagnose, and treat.

Computing plays an integral role in the professional lives of mental health practitioners and studies show that digitally led therapy sessions are on the rise. Task specific tools for practitioners are limited in number and I believe that much can be done to improve practitioners’ Quality of Life by exploring this niche. Through interviews, participatory workshops and design evaluations, I’m interested in identifying key tasks, understanding the pros and cons of existing tools, prototype alternate targeted solutions and evaluate said solutions.

### What does taking part involve?
The participants will be invited to attend interviews expected to last an hour at their convenience in the 1st  week of June. Following this, a participatory design workshop will take place in the 4th  week of June. During the interviews, participants will be asked questions around their practises and the tools they use in the administration of their clinics as well as in sessions. Following this, the design workshops will engage participants by generating further discussion around their problems, ideate solutions, prototype and arrive at a consensus.

### What information will be collected and who will have access to the information collected?
No personal information about the participants or their clients will be collected. Interviews will focus exclusively on practitioners’ work lives and the digital tools they employ. Participants will not be required to share information on sensitive issues. Interview transcripts will only be available with the principal investigator during the duration of the project. Any personal data shared will not be included in the transcripts. Data collected will be anonymised, password protected and stored safely in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). If transcriptions of recorded data are used for research publications in the future, information will remain anonymised.

I will be using your name and contact details [telephone number, email address] to contact you about the research study.
